# Active Querying Approach to Epidemic Source Detection on Contact Networks

Our implementation is heavily based on fast C code for static networks originally written by Petter Holme (thanks!). The code can be found here: https://github.com/pholme/sir.

The code can be compiled and run as follows:
1. Create a directory *o* for the object files and a directory *output* for the output files.
2. Type `make` to compile with gcc.
3. Then run the code with `./run data/er_n100.csv 0.67 5634706295969658060`.

In step 3, we first provide the network file, then the transmission rate (the recovery rate is always 1.0), and finally a random seed for the random number generator. Note that the seed can be generated by running the Python script rnd.py.

In the header file run.h you can change the following parameters:

* Minimal outbreak size that is required for the experiments (`MINOUTBREAK`).
* End of the epidemic (`TEND`).
* Number of time steps to be considered. Together with `TEND` this determines how many times you run the inference/querying (`TSTEPS`).
* Number of Monte-Carlo simulations (`NSIM`).
* Number of experiments (`NEXP`).
* Number of queries (`NQUERIES`).

The example network provided in the directory *data* is an Erdös-Rényi network ($N=100$ and $p=0.05$).
